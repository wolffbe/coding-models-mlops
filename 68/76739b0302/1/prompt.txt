Make install should setup python, install dependencies, install jupyter, and       
  let the user add the keys to huggingface and claude. The notebooks folder          
  should exist anyway as we will be adding notebooks later. Make start should        
  then fire up the jupyter server, and open jupyter in a browser. make stop          
  should shut everything down.
