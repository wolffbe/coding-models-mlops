Remove the old scripts. I want one script per service, and I want it to be K8s-native. No need for k8s-suffix.

I want the orchestration to happen in the make file. Remove the k8s script and incorporate its features into the make file.

Remove any notion of k8s-deploy. Incorporate any related features into make file or the setup scripts for each feature.
